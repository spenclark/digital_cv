  aboutMe:
    "My broad work interest is applying engineering and design to solve business and product problems. I think engineers can take deliverables from start to finish and hiring practices broadly are not recognizing talent. I write about things useful to poeple like me. I have a group side projects primarily in the recruiting and HR industry, which has taught me a lot about time management, business, design, marketing and making real-world products.",
