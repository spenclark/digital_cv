        "Entrepreneurs and makers are chasing recurring revenue for obvious and worthy reasons. However, the goal is not recurring revenue; the goal is to launch, make money, deliver value and improve your offering. Builders and makers trying to bundle services into SaaS applications can often get stuck building just another basket of features.",
        "Humans can start working on complex problems fast, but building software that can do the same task uses expensive resources critical to early-stage projects. Humans don't need to write a bunch of code before being useful. We come pre-installed with tools to thrive in complex environments -- working adaptively with our hands and minds. Markets are kind to this because we have an easier time trusting people than machines. Trust is the best moat and basis of expansion; spending months building products might be slowing you down.",
        "There is a middle ground. DesignJoy, for example, is a $1,500,00 ARR design agency that charges monthly fees for its services. This model solves the problem that cripples so many businesses: cash flow. DesignJoy also shares the distribution benefits that a digital product enjoys. They could use the agency profits could go into the software business by launching a product to an already established list of users. Clipt.co executed a similar transition; I plan to do the same with many projects in my portfolio.",
        "Non-recurring business models are not a death sentence. It gives the option to test your ideas in the market faster while avoiding the costs and pitfalls that stop many projects from taking off. Moreover, you can always convert clients and users into subscriptions later. Many people would be better off rethinking recurring revenue beyond the narrowly defined model that dominates thinking. Act accordingly and keep your palms greasy.",

      paragraphs: [
        "Newsletters have been a hot thing the last few years; I have not been immune to the hype. I have started my newsletters: seniortechtalent.com, remoteengineers.co and canadianengineers.ca. They all profile talent and charge a commission when a reader makes a hire. I will share some observations I have made so far below.",
        "Everyone has an opinion or story to share. So when people start newsletters they are biased toward creating consumable content. They write to build an audience that they can eventually monetize with ads. Prospective editors will painfully toil for months to get a critical mass of readership to sell advertisements. This struggle is not necessary.",
        "My newsletters are not generating significant revenue at this time. But at only a few dozen readers across my talent newsletters, I can still make 1000x more than a newsletter of similar size that sells ads. People read it because they get paid every time they find a great candidate. Start a newsletter where the audience gets directly paid to read it at work.",
        "Of course, I am very late to the game: scottscheapflights.com started almost two decades ago by selling deals for cheap flights and now does tens of millions in revenue; AppSumo, a company now doing $80,000,000 per year started by directly sharing. Cyberleads.com makes 600k annually sending lead emails to agencies. Ungrabbed.com sells catchy domains that are affordable. There are opportunities everywhere.",
        "Unlike those trying to monetize an audience with ads, I avoid the content treadmill. I only write when there is a candidate to share. Readers are happy because talent is in short supply. Unlike opinions. Other newsletters have to post regularly to grow their audience to fill ad slots. Selling products through newsletters can avoid the support a large and expectant audience needs.",
        "Almost anything you can sell in a marketplace or D2C can start as a newsletter. It might be one of the fastest and most friendly ways to validate an idea. The market does not need another opinion or hot take -- the market needs goods and services. I would caveat by saying that information is super valuable, but it's much harder to stand out from the crowd. You are much more likely to succeed in selling something people already want such as domain names or introductions to candidates.",

        "Opportunity is going global. But, separating the chaff from the wheat has never been harder. There is no shortage of tools selling ways to filter talent. Most of them fall short when quantifying what cannot be measured; people cannot be evaluated by a checklist or score. You could be leaving massive talent pools on the table if you do not adapt to the new reality.",
        "Schools (generally) do not produce productive employees who thrive in uncertainty. Screening methods rely far too much on measurable indicators. The interview process rarely reflects the job and can be gamed by candidates. Even references struggle to give honest answers. Those who demonstrate they can do the _acutal_ job but also thrive in a dynamic environment will dominate this century. Exemption to this is corporate welfare jobs or lower leverage jobs where these skills are less valued. ",
        "Everything good that has happened so far in my career has been because I assembled a portfolio of artifacts that show more than any credential or technical interview could and because I will approach clients or companies with a personalized prototype. This is a strategy where the returns far exceed the input. It is surprising how few people will do this. In part, this is due to HR processes that have not caught up with the way modern work is done; most people will do what you tell them to because that is what they think you want. Expectations and outcomes are mismatched in most hiring processes. Ultimately most great hires and relationships come down to “vibes”.",
        "Many candidates are adapting already but organizations should institutionalize unorthodox hiring. For example, work trials have been extremely successful at my alma mater. This is when a company contracts an employee for a period of time before making a hiring decision. You can learn more about it on my job board flyhire.io. This favours candidates who are mispriced by the hiring market and increases variance in your talent pipelines. It lets companies and candidates demonstrate their competency and culture in a practical environment. So far from my experience, the impact is incredible.",

      paragraphs: [
        "Indie hackers and think-bois tell you not to worry about what you name your project and to focus on launching. Those who study behavioural psychology know few decisions will impact your brand perception more than what it gets called. Perception creates reality. Names, as with everything, exist on a spectrum; between utilitarian and egalitarian. The trade-offs are noteworthy.",

        "The completely utilitarian name is an absolute descriptive. For example, a database company of plumbers in Kansas might choose to be called plumbersofkansas.com. These names tend to be popular with resources strapped brick & mortar businesses and indie hackers because they lower market risk by identifying a specific service or problem. You know what to expect when you go to see lessannoyingcrm.com. They also tend to be niche enough that you can buy a great domain without breaking the bank. However, this niche association can become isolating if you plan on expanding past your initial product/market.",

        "Completely egalitarian or aspirational names tend to be nouns. They generally cannot be distinguished by any brand, at least at first. Scrolling through venture-backed startups and boutique retailers you will find a pattern of aspirational and sometimes seemingly pretentious names. Because only a high-status brand should be able to claim something like stripe.com. Apple is an aspirational brand which makes this naming pattern popular for those seeking to mimic their success.  Beware of picking up all the associations an aspirational name has. When you stand for everything; you risk standing for nothing. The value of an aspirational name is clear and the domain market has often priced it in.",

        "There are outliers on my spectrum; those who create an entirely new name. This can be a herculean creative effort, when successful it can move mountains for your brand. The greatest example of this is google.com. Just stating Google here does more than what my words could. Domain traders cannot price in your creativity and ambitions, but avoid ending up being a nobody with a silly name. Google was also called “Backrub” once FYI.",

        "I argue for a median approach. All of my projects get named when I mash two words describing my project together. This gives you a lot of options when naming a project: they tend to be rhythmic, memorable, have two syllables and communicate value. You will be pleasantly surprised to find that not many other people have thought of the same name. DoorDash over Uber. PayPal over Western Union. This method has delivered me names that satisfy most of the benefits across the spectrum without the downsides.",
