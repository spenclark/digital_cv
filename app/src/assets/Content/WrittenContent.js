        "Humans can start working on complex problems fast, but building software that can do the same task uses expensive resources critical to early-stage projects. Humans don't need to write a bunch of code before being useful. We come pre-installed with tools to thrive in complex environments -- working adaptively with our hands and minds.

Act accordingly.",
